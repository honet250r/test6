# Weather Application UI Design

## Goal
To create a stylish and user-friendly UI for a weather application, including components for city selection and weather display.

## Overall Layout (Mobile-First Approach)

## Component Details:

### 1. Header
*   **Content:** Application Name (e.g., "WeatherApp" or a logo).
*   **Style:** Clean, possibly a subtle background color or border.

### 2. City Input Area
*   **Components:**
    *   **Search Bar:**
        *   A text input field with a clear placeholder (e.g., "Search for a city or ZIP code").
        *   A search icon (üîç) integrated within or next to the input field.
        *   Functionality: Should support auto-suggestions as the user types.
    *   **Geolocation Button (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   An icon button (e.g., üìç) to allow users to get weather for their current location.
    *   **Recent/Favorite Cities (Optional):**
        *   A small list or a set of tappable lozenges displaying recently searched or favorited cities for quick access. This could appear below the search bar once a search has been made or if favorites are set.
*   **Style:** Prominent, easy to access at the top of the main view.

### 3. Current Weather Display
*   **Layout:** Centered or well-spaced to be the focal point.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Location:** `City Name, Country` (e.g., "Tokyo, JP"). Font size medium-large.
    *   **Primary Info:**
        *   `[Weather Icon]` (Large, clear visual representation of current conditions).
        *   `Temperature` (Very large font, the most prominent element). Units (¬∞C/¬∞F) should be clear, possibly selectable via settings.
    *   **Secondary Info:**
        *   `Weather Description` (e.g., "Clear Sky", "Scattered Clouds"). Font size medium.
        *   `Feels Like: XX ¬∞C/¬∞F`
        *   `Humidity: XX %`
        *   `Wind: XX km/h [Wind Direction Arrow Icon or Text (e.g., N, S, E, W)]`
        *   `Pressure: XXXX hPa`
        *   `Sunrise: HH:MM AM/PM`
        *   `Sunset: HH:MM AM/PM`
        *   (Possibly: Visibility, UV Index if data is available and relevant)
*   **Style:**
    *   Use of clear, legible fonts.
    *   Good contrast between text and background.
    *   Weather icons should be aesthetically pleasing and universally understandable.
    *   Consider a background that subtly changes based on weather conditions (e.g., a blueish hue for clear sky, grey for cloudy).

### 4. Forecast Display
*   **Layout:** A horizontally scrollable section, typically using cards for each forecast day.
*   **Components (per day card):**
    *   `Day of the Week` (e.g., "Mon", "Tue", "Tomorrow").
    *   `[Weather Icon]` (Smaller than current weather icon, but still clear).
    *   `Max Temperature / Min Temperature` (e.g., "25¬∞ / 18¬∞").
    *   `(Optional) Brief Weather Description` (e.g., "Light Rain").
*   **Style:**
    *   Cards should have consistent padding and spacing.
    *   Visual separation between cards.
    *   Ensure horizontal scrollability is obvious (e.g., partial view of the next card).

### 5. Footer (Optional)
*   **Content:**
    *   Data attribution (e.g., "Powered by OpenWeatherMap").
    *   Link to settings (e.g., unit selection ¬∞C/¬∞F, manage favorite cities).
*   **Style:** Small font, unobtrusive.

## User Experience & Styling Notes:

*   **Responsiveness:** The design should be adaptable. On larger screens (tablets/desktops), the forecast could be displayed as a grid or a more expanded list instead of a horizontal scroll. Current weather and city input might be arranged in columns.
*   **Dark Mode:** Consider a dark mode theme for better readability in low-light conditions and user preference.
*   **Transitions & Animations:** Subtle animations (e.g., when switching cities or loading data) can enhance the user experience but should not be distracting.
*   **Error States:** Design for states like "City not found", "Location services disabled", "No internet connection".
*   **Loading States:** Visual feedback (e.g., a spinner or placeholder UI) while data is being fetched.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure good color contrast, legible font sizes, and consider ARIA attributes for web-based versions.

## Color Palette (Conceptual):
*   **Primary:** A calming blue or a neutral grey.
*   **Accents:** Brighter colors for icons or important information, potentially varying with weather (e.g., yellow for sunny, blue for rainy).
*   **Text:** Dark grey or black for light mode, light grey or white for dark mode.
