# Weather API Research and Selection

## Objective
Research and select a weather API that provides data for Japanese cities. Consider factors like data accuracy, ease of use, and cost.

## Selected API: OpenWeatherMap

OpenWeatherMap ([https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)) has been selected as the preferred weather API.

## Reasons for Selection:

1.  **Data Coverage for Japanese Cities:**
    *   OpenWeatherMap provides global weather data, which includes comprehensive coverage for cities in Japan. They state they use data from global and local weather models, satellites, radars, and a vast network of weather stations.

2.  **Ease of Use:**
    *   **Data Format:** API responses are available in JSON, which is lightweight and widely supported.
    *   **Documentation:** They offer extensive API documentation ([https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)) with clear examples.
    *   **Location Lookup:** Supports various methods for location lookup, including city name, city ID, ZIP/postal code, and latitude/longitude coordinates, which is helpful for diverse input formats and international use. Their Geocoding API ([https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)) is also available.

3.  **Cost-Effectiveness:**
    *   **"One Call API 3.0" Free Tier:** Offers 1,000 API calls per day free of charge. This plan includes current weather, minute forecasts (1 hour), hourly forecasts (48 hours), daily forecasts (8 days), government weather alerts, and access to historical data. This is suitable for development, testing, and potentially low-traffic production applications.
    *   **Alternative "Free" Tier:** Provides 1,000,000 calls/month (60 calls/minute) and includes current weather, 5-day/3-hour forecast, basic weather maps, air pollution data, and geocoding.
    *   **Scalability:** Paid plans are available, starting from a "Startup" tier, offering increased call limits and additional features if the free tier becomes insufficient.
    *   **Licensing:** The "One Call API 3.0" free tier uses CC BY-SA 4.0 and ODbL, which requires attribution and share-alike if the data is transformed or built upon. This is a reasonable requirement for a free service. Paid tiers offer more flexible business licenses.

4.  **Accuracy:**
    *   OpenWeatherMap mentions utilizing a variety of data sources, including global and local weather models, satellites, radars, and a vast network of weather stations. This multi-source approach generally leads to better accuracy.

5.  **Feature Set (Free Tier - One Call API 3.0):**
    *   Current weather data.
    *   Short-term forecasts (minute-by-minute for 1 hour, hourly for 48 hours).
    *   Mid-term forecasts (daily for 8 days).
    *   Access to national weather alerts.
    *   Historical weather data.

## Other APIs Considered:

*   **weatherstack ([https://weatherstack.com/](https://weatherstack.com/)):**
    *   **Pros:** Clear documentation, good feature set, offers a free plan.
    *   **Cons:** The free plan is very limited (100 calls/month), making it less suitable for even moderate development use compared to OpenWeatherMap's free offerings. Paid plans are comparable to OpenWeatherMap but the initial free access is a significant differentiator.

## Conclusion:

OpenWeatherMap, particularly its "One Call API 3.0," provides the best balance of generous free access, comprehensive weather data (including for Japanese cities), ease of use, and scalability for future needs. The attribution requirement for the free tier is manageable for most projects.
